        <p>Hi! I’m Eliza! I’m originally from Columbus, Ohio (Go Bucks!). I have one sister named Elle and a fur baby nephew named Archie - they live in LA. My parents live in Florida, so I get to visit the beach when I go home!</p><br>
        <p>I've lived in Boston for four years and have worked as an e-commerce buyer in textiles and children’s apparel, along with working in retail and home decor. I’m also a freelance artist specializing in watercolor painting. </p><br>
        <p>In my free time, I like to spin, enjoy the outdoors, play Nintendo Switch, and listen to Podcasts (always looking for new recommendations!).</p><br>
